# <Cool-Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

- I built this so people can better organize their schedule.
- I got to learn how the transition property can be used to make buttons be animated as you hover over them.
- I also had to learn day.js, and that I need to use the 'dayjs.get()' command or else it will give me a string and not a number.
